Very early prototype of a fine-graind authorization module.

All specs (rspec) currently pass.

TODO: 

Use this module in the context of a rails app

ISSUES:

-Not sure how to override initialize in rails?
-Is there a better way to achieve the same goal, namely, protecting methods using a series of tags

First Thoughts:

-Override send/__send__ , making an authorized_send instead of doing the auth checks upon initialization?
-Use a before_filter?
-Detach all methods usig to_proc and redefine ones for which the user is authorized
-Hackery with alias_method_chain
